      'As a first home owner, the process of finding an appropriate loan and dealing with a lender was both daunting and confusing so I was greatly relieved to have someone like Belinda to help and support me through the whole process. I found Belinda an extremely helpful and professional mortgage broker. She was always quick to respond to questions and able to explain things in a way I could understand and willing to help me with solutions as my needs changed. I have now bought a lovely unit and have a mortgage that I am very happy with. I can’t thank Belinda enough!',

      'Belinda helped us select the best loan to suit our current home as well as our future property investment needs.  She was knowledgeable, always approachable and above all, patient with our many questions.  She was available to talk us through any problems/queries that arose and at any time of the day or night!  In our years of experience with other mortgage brokers we quickly learned once the loan was settled, we didn’t hear from them again. This was not the case with Belinda. The relationship is ongoing and I’m sure as our circumstances change over the coming years, Belinda will be there to help us make good financial choices.',

      'We were very happy with the way Belinda from Golden Eggs Home Loans handled our home mortgage. We were unsure if we should renovate or sell and buy a new home and Belinda gave us a wide range of options to consider.  She was also continually thinking out-of-the-box for ways to get us what we needed. We procrastinated for months but Belinda always kept us informed on market changes and when we were ready to move, she helped us get a great loan that suited us perfectly. She held our hand through the entire processes and even now, many months after we settled on our home she still helps us with any questions regarding our loan. I would definitely recommend Belinda and Golden Eggs Home Loans to anyone wanting personal, professional home loan help.',

      'I recently used Golden Eggs Home Loans after being referred by a friend. Belinda was immensely helpful in taking me through all the home loan options based on my circumstances. She was always responsive when I had questions and was happy to meet anytime. My loan application (with a very competitive rate) was approved and I was thrilled. Thank you so much for a fantastic service, I will be recommending you to others.  ',
